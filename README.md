# toy-shell

First, I created calculator file coding. This is an executable file that comes out when you type calculator, run the file, enter the operator first, and then enter two numbers, as uploaded in shell example.

The second is an even odd separator. This is an executable file that separates the oedistributor by entering it and receiving 30 numbers as the shell uploaded in the example.

Lastly, the third is item inventory. Please enter the item Inventor as above and enter it according to the form.
I turned the loop number 3 and made it possible to input 3 and added more if I was increased. What you want to enter is the name, number, price, and quantity.

The names of each c file are caculator, itinventor, and oedistributor.

I tried to make other things, but I couldn't write more because I only knew the basics of C. I will try harder and become a developer from now on.
